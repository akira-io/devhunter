## 💡 Problem

Current platforms don’t fully value the developer as a creator:

- Portfolios are often static and lack personality.
- GitHub, while technical, is impersonal.
- There is little space for devs to share ideas, thoughts, and reflections.
- Communities are often fragmented, making it hard to build relationships and grow.

- Create detailed profiles and showcase their skills and achievements.
